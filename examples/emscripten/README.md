# Emscripten with NimraylibNow!

This is experimental support for Emscripten. Please report any bugs.

1. Follow an amazing treeform's guide [Nim Emscripten tutorial]. As of 2021-05-08
   only steps 0, 1 and 2 work, it is okay if 3 and 4 do not compile.
2. Compile the Nim source file:
```
$ nim c -o:public/index.html emscripten_crown.nim
```
3. Install and run `nimhttpd` server:
```
$ nimble install nimhttpd
$ nimhttpd
```
4. Open the output file in a browser http://localhost:1337/public/.

## Tips and tricks

- Make sure to include `config.nims` in the same directory as your source file
  and edit it if needed.
- Replace `while not windowShouldClose():` used for native compilation
  with `emscriptenSetMainLoop` and a callback as in the example.
